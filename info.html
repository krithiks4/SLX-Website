            <h2>The Science Behind Urban Heat Islands</h2>
            <p>Urban Heat Islands (UHIs) occur when cities experience higher temperatures than surrounding rural areas. This temperature difference can range from 1-7°C, with the most significant disparities typically occurring at night. The phenomenon was first documented in the early 19th century but has intensified with modern urbanization.</p>
            
            <h3>Primary Causes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Reduced Vegetation:</strong> Trees and plants provide natural cooling through shade and evapotranspiration. Urban areas typically have less greenery, reducing these cooling effects.</li>
                <li><strong>Heat-Absorbing Materials:</strong> Dark surfaces like asphalt roads and rooftops absorb up to 90% of sunlight, converting it to heat.</li>
                <li><strong>Urban Geometry:</strong> Tall buildings create "urban canyons" that trap heat and block wind, preventing cooling.</li>
                <li><strong>Anthropogenic Heat:</strong> Human activities like transportation, industrial processes, and air conditioning release additional heat into urban environments.</li>
                <li><strong>Reduced Airflow:</strong> Dense building arrangements restrict air movement that would otherwise help dissipate heat.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Impacts of Urban Heat Islands</h2>
            
            <h3>Environmental Impacts</h3>
            <p>UHIs contribute to increased energy consumption, elevated emissions of air pollutants and greenhouse gases, compromised water quality, and altered local weather patterns. Studies have shown that UHIs can even influence precipitation patterns, sometimes increasing rainfall downwind of cities.</p>
            
            <h3>Health Impacts</h3>
            <p>The health consequences of UHIs are severe and disproportionately affect vulnerable populations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Heat-related illnesses and mortality increase during extreme heat events</li>
                <li>Respiratory problems worsen due to increased ground-level ozone formation</li>
                <li>Cardiovascular stress increases, particularly among elderly residents</li>
                <li>Sleep quality deteriorates during hot nights, affecting overall health</li>
                <li>Mental health issues can be exacerbated by heat stress</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Economic Impacts</h3>
            <p>The economic burden of UHIs includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Increased cooling costs for buildings (up to 5-10% higher energy bills)</li>
                <li>Reduced worker productivity during extreme heat</li>
                <li>Healthcare costs associated with heat-related illnesses</li>
                <li>Infrastructure strain on electrical grids during peak cooling demand</li>
                <li>Accelerated deterioration of infrastructure due to heat stress</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Social Equity Concerns</h3>
            <p>UHIs often disproportionately affect lower-income neighborhoods with less green space, older housing stock, and fewer resources for cooling. This creates a climate justice issue where the most vulnerable populations face the greatest heat-related risks.</p>
